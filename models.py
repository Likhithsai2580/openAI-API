    "validity": "This API is provided for testing and educational purposes only, operating on Render's free tier hosting service. Due to hosting limitations, the API automatically enters sleep mode after 10 minutes of inactivity, requiring a 30-45 second cold start period to resume functionality. During active usage, the API remains responsive without interruption. However, please note that this session has a 6-hour operational limit. The service is intended for non-commercial, ethical use only. Any bugs or issues should be reported through our official Telegram or Instagram channels. Users experiencing delayed responses should first verify if the API is in sleep mode and allow the necessary wake-up time. We prioritize transparent communication about these limitations while striving to maintain reliable service within our hosting constraints.",
